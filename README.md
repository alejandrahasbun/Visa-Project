EasyVisa Project
The EasyVisa project aims to simplify the visa application process by utilizing machine learning techniques to analyze visa application data. 
The goal is to develop a classification model that helps improve visa approval decisions by identifying key factors that influence whether an application is approved or denied.
This project utilizes the following Python libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations on arrays.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models, including:
train_test_split: To split the dataset into training and testing sets.
GridSearchCV: For hyperparameter tuning.
BaggingClassifier and RandomForestClassifier: For ensemble learning models.
LogisticRegression: For a baseline classification model.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
